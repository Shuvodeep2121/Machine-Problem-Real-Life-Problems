# Machine-Problem-Real-Life-Problems
In this Folder Package, there is a Complete Machine Learning Training which starts from basic and ends up to several small & Speacially 5 Different Real Life Projects.

These 5 Different real Life Projects are :

Project 1 - Handwriting Prediction => In this project, you’ll see how to analyse the handwritten digit by predicting the average reviews of digit rescognition ny Random Forest Algorithm in this project.

Project 2 – Text Analysis(Spam Recognition) => In this project, you’ll learn to filter the written text digitally and scan if their is frequent repeatation of same words and detect the significant word as Spam.

Project 3 – Stock Market Prediction => This Project will help us to learn how to use the K-means clustering algorithm to find related companies by finding correlations among stock market movements over a given time span and predict which company will give a better price in the stocke's exchange in next coming future.

Project 4 – Breast Cancer Determination => This project will focus on Image Analysis Technology. By using KNN Algorithm & Deep Learning Methodology it can recognise if the Testing Breast Scan Image has the similar pattern of Cancer or not from the given trained database.

Project 5– Movie Recommendation Engine => In this project, will use the movie_name dataset as a benchmark to determine what Movie will you like to see accordimg to the searched movie name and category.
